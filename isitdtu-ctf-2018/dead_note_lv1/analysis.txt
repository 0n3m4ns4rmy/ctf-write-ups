- a bunch of rwx sections including stack and heap
- no limit on the note index so we can write the address pointing to our string on the heap to any address we want
- we can only write 3 bytes to the heap because it checks with strlen if the length is less our equal to 3
- we can overwrite strlen got entry with a function that returns 0
